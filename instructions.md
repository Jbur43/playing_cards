Hi Jack,

Tien enjoyed chatting with you and we'd like to ask you to complete the next step in our process. See below for details of the exercise and let me know if you have any questions:

Pretend we are a casino, and we’ve hired you to design a library for us. This library will provide the functionality of a deck of playing cards, using any object-oriented language. It can be in Ruby or the language of your choice. We are not looking for a game or simulation, but just a library that another developer could use and reasonably trust.

At a minimum, the library should be able to shuffle the deck of cards, deal a hand, and take back discarded cards from a hand. We would also like a developer to easily provide their own shuffle algorithm if your default one needs to change.

A few notes:
Feel free to apply any development best practices you feel are warranted for a prospective user of the library to trust or want to use it

Please use a service like Github or Bitbucket for your revision control and email a link to the work when you’re ready

We recognize you have a life and may need a few days or so to do this

Once we have this back from you, we'll review right away and confirm next steps which would include a full day onsite interview with our team.

Thanks
